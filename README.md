# Vehicle re-Identification

## Introduction

Vehicle  re-Identification  aims  to  identify  the  samevehicle  across  the  different  cameras.  It  has  useful  applicationsin  surveillance  and  intelligent  transport  systems.  One  of  thefundamental  challenges  of  vehicle  re-identification  is  how  tolearn  robust  and  discriminative  visual  features  given  in  smallinter-class  similarity  and  large  intra-class  differences  that  donâ€™tfollow the same distribution. In this project we propose to treatthe  re-identification  problem  as  a  domain  adaptation  task.  We implemented  the  Deep  Joint  Domain  Adaptation  algorithm  totrain  a  model  that  could  robustly  detect  the  same  classes  evenwhen  the  images  were  obtained  in  different  conditions.
